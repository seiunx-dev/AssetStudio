## About this fork

This repository is a fork of [aelurum/AssetStudioMod](https://github.com/aelurum/AssetStudioMod). Its default branch, `sekai-modified`, adds the following on top of upstream:

- `AssetStudioCore`: the loading and export engine, split out so that the CLI and the FFI library share one implementation (targets net472, net8.0, net9.0 and net10.0).
- `AssetStudioFFI`: a NativeAOT shared library (`HarukiAssetStudioFFI`, net10.0) with a typed C ABI declared in `AssetStudioFFI/haruki_assetstudio_native.h`, plus a Rust wrapper crate in `AssetStudioFFI/rust/haruki-assetstudio`. See [README.FFI.md](AssetStudioFFI/README.FFI.md).
- Extra CLI options `--filter-exclude-mode` and `--strip-path-prefix`. See the fork's [CLI readme](AssetStudioCLI/ReadMe.md).

The release, download and build badges above, the CHANGELOG and the requirements below describe upstream AssetStudioMod. This fork does not publish releases. Contributor notes for this fork are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

### Basic Samples

- Show a list with a number of assets of each type available for export
```
AssetStudioModCLI <asset folder path> -m info
```
- Export assets of all supported for export types
```
AssetStudioModCLI <asset folder path>
```
- Export assets of specific types

## GUI Usage

### Load Assets/AssetBundles

Use **File->Load file** or **File->Load folder**.

When AssetStudio loads AssetBundles, it decompresses and reads it directly in memory, which may cause a large amount of memory to be used. You can use **File->Extract file** or **File->Extract folder** to extract AssetBundles to another folder, and then read.

### Extract/Decompress AssetBundles

Use **File->Extract file** or **File->Extract folder**.

### Export Assets, Live2D models

Use **Export** menu.

### Export Model

Export model from "Scene Hierarchy" using the **Model** menu.

Export Animator from "Asset List" using the **Export** menu.

#### With AnimationClip

Select model from "Scene Hierarchy" then select the AnimationClip from "Asset List", using **Model->Export selected objects with AnimationClip** to export.

Export Animator will export bound AnimationClip or use **Ctrl** to select Animator and AnimationClip from "Asset List", using **Export->Export Animator with selected AnimationClip** to export.

### Export MonoBehaviour

When you select an asset of the MonoBehaviour type for the first time, AssetStudio will ask you the directory where the assembly is located, please select the directory where the assembly is located, such as the `Managed` folder.

#### For Il2Cpp

First, use [Il2CppDumper](https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper) to generate dummy dll, then when using AssetStudio to select the assembly directory, select the dummy dll folder.

## Build

* Visual Studio 2022 or newer
* **AssetStudioFBXNative** uses [FBX SDK 2020.2.1](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/fbx-sdk-2020-2-1), before building, you need to install the FBX SDK and modify the project file, change include directory and library directory to point to the FBX SDK directory
